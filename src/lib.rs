//! WebTransport is a protocol for client-server communication over QUIC.
//!
//! It's [available in the browser](https://caniuse.com/webtransport) as an
//! alternative to HTTP and WebSockets.
//!
//! WebTransport is layered on top of HTTP/3 which is then layered on top of QUIC.
//!
//! This crate implements the [web-transport-trait] session and stream traits for iroh [connections] and streams.
//! A web-transport-iroh session can either use an iroh connection directly, or run HTTP/3 over the iroh connection.
//! The latter includes the WebTransport request-response handshake, through which a request target and headers can
//! be set.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! WebTransport is able to be pooled with HTTP/3 and multiple WebTransport sessions.
//! This crate avoids that complexity, doing the bare minimum to support a single
//! WebTransport session that owns the entire QUIC connection.
//! If you want to support multiple WebTransport sessions over the same QUIC connection...
//! you should just dial a new QUIC connection instead.
